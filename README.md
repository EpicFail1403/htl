# Hydrothermal liquefaction

A factorio (http://www.factorio.com/) mod that adds a technology and a recipe to turn raw-wood into crude-oil by adding steam. The process is similar to the base games coal liquefaction but simpler and with a lot less output. The idea is simply to give some meaning to all the raw-wood that usually piles up in ones base after some time.

The process is based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_liquefaction
